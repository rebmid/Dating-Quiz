    "answers":["Yes -always","No -thats creepy"],"correct":1,"explanation":"If you have not you should be doing this for every single date. You can see family, location, work, and get a good idea if your potential date is still married or what he is all about. Does his address history show women living with him? Does he work where he says? Does he have a criminal record? Do not reveal that you are searching, just incorporate this into your routine. Quietly do your homework.
